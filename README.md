# DecisionTreesAndSVMsOnIris

### Name
Weiwei Chen

### Description
For this project, two machine learning algorithms—decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs) will be
used to do the classification task on the same data set—Iris plant data set. The data set will be separated
into training data and test data. We will train on the training data, get the model and run the model on 
the test data. After several different experiments, the results from these two algorithms will be obtained, 
and then they will be compared.

### Build, Install and Run
You don't need to build anything, only you should do is to install Python.
Run command: python Main.py

### Sample result

Accuracy by SVM = 0.983333333333<br />
Confusion matrix:
[[22  0  0]
 [ 0 16  1]
 [ 0  0 21]]
 
weight = [0.16409864 0.53568276 0.82586038 0.62245645]
